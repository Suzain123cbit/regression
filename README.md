# R You Ready for Regression?

This project demonstrates linear regression analysis in R using two built-in datasets: `mtcars` and `iris`.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Dataset: `mtcars`
- Built a linear regression model to predict `mpg` based on `wt`
- Visualized the relationship between car weight and mileage

### 2. Dataset: `iris`
- Built a linear regression model to predict `Sepal.Length` based on `Petal.Length`
- Visualized the relationship between petal and sepal lengths

## Files

- `regression_analysis.R` – R script performing both regression analyses
- `regression_plot1_mtcars.png` – Regression plot for `mtcars`
- `regression_plot2_iris.png` – Regression plot for `iris`

## How to Run

```r
source("regression_analysis.R")

### ✅ Next Steps for You

1. Replace your current:
   - `regression_analysis.R` with the new script above
   - `README.md` with the updated version
2. Run the R script to generate:
   - `regression_plot1_mtcars.png`
   - `regression_plot2_iris.png`
3. Push all files to GitHub:
